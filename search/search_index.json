The fix includes a mandatory change of the base font-size from 10px to 20px which means all rem values needed to be updated. Within the theme, px to rem calculation is now encapsulated in a new function called px2rem which is part of the SASS code base. If you use Material with custom CSS that is based on rem values, note that those values must now be divided by 2. Now, 1.0rem doesn't map to 10px , but 20px . To learn more about the problem and implications, please refer to the issue in which the problem was discovered and fixed. Material 2.x to 3.x \u00b6 Material for MkDocs 3.x requires MkDocs 1.0 because the way paths are resolved internally changed significantly. Furthermore, pages was renamed to nav , so remember to adjust your mkdocs.yml file. All extended templates should continue to work but in order to make them future-proof the url filter should be introduced on all paths. Please see the official release notes for further guidance. Material 1.x to 2.x \u00b6 Material for MkDocs 2.x requires MkDocs 0.17.1, as this version introduced changes to the way themes can define options. The following variables inside your project's mkdocs.yml need to be renamed: extra.feature becomes theme.feature extra.palette becomes theme.palette extra.font becomes theme.font extra.logo becomes theme.logo Favicon support has been dropped by MkDocs, it must now be defined in theme.favicon (previously site_favicon ). Localization is now separated into theme language and search language. While there can only be a single language on theme-level, the search supports multiple languages which can be separated by commas. See the getting started guide for more guidance. The search tokenizer can now be set through extra.search.tokenizer .

Getting Started With PHP \u00b6 Section 1.1: HTML output from web server \u00b6 PHP can be used to add content to HTML files. While HTML is processed directly by a web browser, PHP scripts are executed by a web server and the resulting HTML is sent to the browser. The following HTML markup contains a PHP statement that will add Hello World! to the output <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > < title > PHP! </ title > </ head > < body > < p > <?php echo \"Hello world!\"; ?> </ p > </ body > </ html > When this is saved as a PHP script and executed by a web server, the following HTML will be sent to the user's browser: <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > < title > PHP! </ title > </ head > < body > < p > Hello world! </ p > </ body ></ html > echo also has a shortcut syntax, which lets you immediately print a value. Prior to PHP 5.4.0, this short syntax onlyworks with the short_open_tag configuration setting enabled. For example, consider the following code: <p> <? = \"Hello world!\" ?> </p> Its output is identical to the output of the following: <p> <?php echo \"Hello world!\" ; ?> </p> In real-world applications, all data output by PHP to an HTML page should be properly escaped to prevent XSS(Cross-site scripting) attacks or text corruption. See also: Strings and PSR-1 , which describes best practices, including the proper use of short tags ( <? =... ?> ). Section 1.2: Hello, World! \u00b6 The most widely used language construct to print output in PHP is echo : echo \"Hello, World!\\n\" ; Alternatively, you can also use print : print \"Hello, World!\\n\" ; Both statements perform the same function, with minor differences: echo has a void return, whereas print returns an int with a value of 1 echo can take multiple arguments (without parentheses only), whereas print only takes one argument echo is slightly faster than print Both echo and print are language constructs, not functions. That means they do not require parentheses around their arguments. For cosmetic consistency with functions, parentheses can be included. Extensive examples of the use of echo and print are available elsewhere. C-style printf and related functions are available as well, as in the following example: printf ( \"%s\\n\" , \"Hello, World!\" ) ; See Outputting the value of a variable for a comprehensive introduction of outputting variables in PHP. Section 1.3: Non-HTML output from web server \u00b6 In some cases, when working with a web server, overriding the web server's default content type may be required.There may be cases where you need to send data as plain text, JSON, or XML, for example. The header() function can send a raw HTTP header. You can add the Content-Type header to notify the browser of the content we are sending. Consider the following code, where we set Content-Type as text/plain : header ( \"Content-Type: text/plain\" ) ; echo \"Hello World\" ; This will produce a plain text document with the following content: Hello World To produce JSON content, use the application/json content type instead: header ( \"Content-Type: application/json\" ) ; // Create a PHP data array. $data =[ \"response\" = > \"Hello World\" ] ; // json_encode will convert it to a valid JSON string. echo json_encode ( $data ) ; This will produce a document of type application/json with the following content: {\"response\":\"Hello World\"} Note that the header() function must be called before PHP produces any output, or the web server will have already sent headers for the response. So, consider the following code: // Error: We cannot send any output before the headers echo \"Hello\" ; // All headers must be sent before ANY PHP output header ( \"Content-Type: text/plain\" ) ; echo \"World\" ; This will produce a warning: Warning Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at/dir/example.php:2) in /dir/example.php on line 3 When using header() , its output needs to be the first byte that's sent from the server. For this reason it's important to not have empty lines or spaces in the beginning of the file before the PHP opening tag <?php . For the same reason, it is considered best practice (see PSR-2 ) to omit the PHP closing tag ?> from files that contain only PHP andfrom blocks of PHP code at the very end of a file. View the output buffering section to learn how to 'catch' your content into a variable to output later, for example,after outputting headers. Section 1.4: PHP built-in server \u00b6 PHP 5.4+ comes with a built-in development server. It can be used to run applications without having to install aproduction HTTP server such as nginx or Apache. The built-in server is only designed to be used for developmentand testing purposes. php -S : Example usage Create an index.php file containing: <?php echo \"Hello World from built-in PHP server\" ; ?> Run the command php -S localhost:8080 from the command line. Do not include http:// This will start a web server listening on port 8080 using the current directory that you are in as the document root. Open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 . You should see your \"Hello World\" page. Configuration \u00b6 To override the default document root (i.e. the current directory), use the -t flag: php -S <host/ip>:<port> -t <directory> E.g. if you have a public/ directory in your project you can serve your project from that directory using php -S localhost:8080 -t public/ . Logs \u00b6 Every time a request is made from the development server, a log entry like the one below is written to thecommand line. [ Mon Aug 15 18 :20:19 2016 ] ::1:52455 [ 200 ] : / Section 1.5: PHP CLI \u00b6 PHP can also be run from command line directly using the CLI (Command Line Interface). CLI is basically the same as PHP from web servers, except some differences in terms of standard input and output. Triggering \u00b6 The PHP CLI allows four ways to run PHP code: Standard input. Run the php command without any arguments, but pipe PHP code into it: echo ' <?php echo \"Hello world!\" ; ' | php Filename as argument. Run the php command with the name of a PHP source file as the first argument: php hello_world.php Code as argument. Use the -r option in the php command, followed by the code to run. The <?php open tags are not required, as everything in the argument is considered as PHP code: php -r 'echo \"Hello world!\"; 'Interactive shell. Use the -a option in the php command to launch an interactive shell. Then, type (or paste)PHP code and hit return : $ php -a Interactive mode enabled php > echo \"Hello world!\"; Hello world! Output \u00b6 All functions or controls that produce HTML output in web server PHP can be used to produce output in the stdout stream (file descriptor 1), and all actions that produce output in error logs in web server PHP will produce output in the stderr stream (file descriptor 2). Example.php <?php echo \"Stdout 1\\n\" ; trigger_error ( \"Stderr 2\\n\" ) ; print_r ( \"Stdout 3\\n\" ) ; fwrite ( STDERR, \"Stderr 4\\n\" ) ; throw new RuntimeException ( \"Stderr 5\\n\" ) ; ?> Stdout 6 Shell command line \u00b6 $ php Example.php 2 >stderr.log>stdout.log ; \\ > echo STDOUT ; cat stdout.log ; echo ; \\ > echo STDERR ; cat stderr.log \\ STDOUT Stdout 1 Stdout 3 STDERR Stderr 4 PHP Notice: Stderr 2 in /Example.php on line 3 PHP Fatal error: Uncaught RuntimeException: Stderr 5 in /Example.php:6 Stack trace: #0 {main} thrown in /Example.php on line 6 Input \u00b6 See: Command Line Interface(CLI) Section 1.6: Instruction Separation \u00b6 Just like most other C-style languages, each statement is terminated with a semicolon. Also, a closing tag is used to terminate the last line of code of the PHP block. If the last line of PHP code ends with a semicolon, the closing tag is optional if there is no code following that final line of code. For example, we can leave out the closing tag after echo\"No error\"; in the following example: <?php echo \"No error\" ; // no closing tag is needed as long as there is no code below However, if there is any other code following your PHP code block, the closing tag is no longer optional: <?php echo \"This will cause an error if you leave out the closing tag\" ; ?> <html> <body> </body> </html> We can also leave out the semicolon of the last statement in a PHP code block if that code block has a closing tag: <?php echo \"I hope this helps! :D\" ; echo \"No error\" ?>","title":"1.
